primes are without factors other than 1 and themselves. and we note that the larger a number is the less chance of it being prime as there are more possible prime numbers that may be factors of it, maijg. them more prilific, this also means that with the knowledge of all primes begire one we could theoretically compute the next prime woth ease and 1-shot.
