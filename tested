Time functions as a temporal step in reality for the grand emulation of reality to function in relation to itself. Time functions at the speed of light and as such our tick speed is that of the speed of light. The world is one large self referential system propagated under the tick speed and steps of time itself at the speed of light, the universe relates all things in a multitude of ways convoluted and easy to see, large scale and small. A self referential system is similar to this logic here 

Go through every number 1-infinity, if the number is odd change the next number by the count of odd numbers then do the same to that and continue. 

This system makes it literally impossible to do it in any non-iterative way as it makes sure that there is no linear way of doing things, your input output may look like this 

Temporal: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Adjusted for logic: 1+0, 2+1, 3+2, 5+3, 8+3, 11+3

Because of this simple rule we end up with a chaotic system unpredictable to the infinite without constant recursion and an understanding of all previous values. It is a infinitely building self referential system, chaos.
