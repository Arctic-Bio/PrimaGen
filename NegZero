#Okay so oddly enough negative zero, such as a 0 but with a negative connontation, such as a void tha tis outside of equilibrium with things such as a negative sp[atial voide instead of a neutral one tha tdoesnt suck up everything in existance, or a positive one that repels all things in existance, seems to work for primes? Als oI know that rthis is some heavy theoretical stuff and it was 2AM when I wrote this code so bear with it please.
